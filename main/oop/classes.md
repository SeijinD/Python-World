# Classes
---

A class is a blueprint for the object.

#### Example:
```python
class Dog:
    pass
```

We create a new **class** using the class statement and the name of the class. This is followed by an indented block of statements which form the body of the class. In this case, we have an empty block which is indicated using the **pass** statement.
