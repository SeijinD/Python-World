# Objects
---

An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. 

#### Example:
```python
obj = Dog()
```

Here, **obj** is object of class **Dog**.

#### Example:
```python
a = Dog()
b = Dog()
a == b # False, They are different objects.
```
```python
a = Dog()
type(a) # <class '__main__.Dog'>
```
