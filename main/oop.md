# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
---

#### What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.

One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

OOP uses the concept of **objects** and **classes**. A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. These can have their own **attributes** (characteristics they possess), and **methods** (actions they perform).
##### An example:

Dog is an object,
~~~~
name, age, color are attributes
eating, running are methods
~~~~
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
