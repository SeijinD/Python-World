# Scrapy
---

Scrapy is an open source python framework built specifically for web scraping by Scrapinghub co-founders Pablo Hoffman and Shane Evans.
It means that Scrapy is a fully fledged web scraping solution that takes a lot of the work out of building and configuring your spiders, and best of all, it seamlessly deals with edge cases that you probably havenâ€™t thought of yet.
Within minutes of installing the framework, you can have a fully functioning spider scraping the web. Out of the box, Scrapy spiders are designed to download HTML, parse and process the data and save it in either CSV, JSON or XML file formats.

- Install Scrapy
```python
pip install scrapy
```
- Use Scrapy
```python
import scrapy
```
