# SciPy
---

#### What is Scipy?
SciPy is an open-source Python library which is used to solve scientific and mathematical problems. It is built on the NumPy extension and allows the user to manipulate and visualize data with a wide range of high-level commands. As mentioned earlier, SciPy builds on NumPy and therefore if you import SciPy, there is no need to import NumPy.


#### SciPy vs [NumPy](numpy.md)
Both NumPy and SciPy are Python libraries used for used mathematical and numerical analysis. NumPy contains array data and basic operations such as sorting, indexing, etc whereas, SciPy consists of all the numerical code. Though NumPy provides a number of functions that can help resolve linear algebra, Fourier transforms, etc, SciPy is the library that actually contains fully-featured versions of these functions along with many others. However, if you are doing scientific analysis using Python, you will need to install both NumPy and SciPy since SciPy builds on NumPy.

#### Install SciPy
```python
pip install scipy
```

#### Import SciPy
```python
import from scipy import linalg, sparse
```
