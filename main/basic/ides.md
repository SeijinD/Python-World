# IDEs

- ### PyCharm
##### Website: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

One of the best (and only) full-featured, dedicated IDEs for Python is PyCharm. Available in both paid (Professional) and free open-source (Community) editions, PyCharm installs quickly and easily on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

Out of the box, PyCharm supports Python development directly. You can just open a new file and start writing code. You can run and debug Python directly inside PyCharm, and it has support for source control and projects.

- ### Spyder
##### Website: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder

Spyder is an open-source Python IDE thatâ€™s optimized for data science workflows. Spyder comes included with the Anaconda package manager distribution, so depending on your setup you may already have it installed on your machine.

- ### Visual Studio Code
##### Website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
##### Python tools: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

Not to be confused with full Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) is a full-featured code editor available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms. Small and light-weight, but full-featured, VS Code is open-source, extensible, and configurable for almost any task. Like Atom, VS Code is built on Electron, so it has the same advantages and disadvantages that brings.

Installing Python support in VS Code is very accessible: the Marketplace is a quick button click away. Search for Python, click Install, and restart if necessary. VS Code will recognize your Python installation and libraries automatically.
